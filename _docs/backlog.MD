### v2.0.0 ðŸ”¥ | `feature/mistery-goglins-mode`
> Goal: Activate "Goggins Mode" â€” a mysterious floating button opens a modal asking for email. After a valid email and clicking "Surprise Me", generate a short, intense, motivational message tailored for builders version 18+ and version 18- (depending on choice, either safe and respectful tone or adult language, profanity or insults; motivate with discipline, ownership, and action.) using the existing OpenAI service.
