Moving on with the BNB: Bread n‚Äô Butter üçûüßà series, it‚Äôs time to look at the other half of the MERN stack: Node.js, Express, and Apollo.

This combo is fast, flexible, and free to use - powering everything from REST APIs to GraphQL endpoints.

# Backend (Node.js/Express/Apollo)
> ***Daily tools when wiring APIs***

---

## 1. Modules (import/require)
- Split code into small files: `db.ts`, `user.ts`, `article.ts`
- Node's bread and butter: everything is modular!
- Example:
```ts
import { db } from './db';
import { user } from './user';
import { article } from './article';
```

## 2. Asyncronous operations (async/await)
- Almost everything on the backend is async: database queries, API calls, file system ops. That‚Äôs why async/await is your best friend.
- Example:
```ts
const user = await db.user.findById(id);
```

## 3. Routing/Resolvers
- Express handles REST-style routes:
```ts
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => { ... })
```
- Apollo handles GraphQL queries/mutations:
```ts
userQueries.user = async (_: any, { id }: { id: string }) => { ... }
```
- Just like Next.js has pages, these wire up your API logic.

## 4. Middleware
- Functions that sit **between** requests and responses. Think of them as "filters" or "guards".
- Express: 
```ts
app.use((req, res, next) => { ... })
```
- Apollo: 
```ts
expressMiddleware(server, { 
  context: async ({ req }: any) => { ... } 
})
```
- Examples: Authentication, Logging, Rate Limiting

## 5. Environment Config (dotenv)
- Never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables for things like PORT, DB_URI, API keys.
- Example:
```ts
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const dbUri = process.env.DB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp';
```

## 6. Database Models (Mongoose)
- This is the backend‚Äôs ‚Äústate‚Äù ‚Äî persistent data.
- Define structure and relationships using schemas.
- Example:
```ts
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
});
```

## The Bread n‚Äô Butter Flow:

Modules ‚Üí Async/Await ‚Üí Routing/Resolvers ‚Üí Middleware ‚Üí Env Config ‚Üí Database Models

Master these, and you can wire up APIs for anything from a small SaaS to enterprise-scale systems.

How about you, this time, any personal ‚Äúbread n‚Äô butter‚Äù in backend? 
Anything you can‚Äôt live without? Share with me, I'm even more curious!!!
